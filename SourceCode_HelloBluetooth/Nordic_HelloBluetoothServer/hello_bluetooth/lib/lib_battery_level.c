/*
The discharge curve for CR2032 is non-linear. In this model it is split into
4 linear sections:
- Section 1: 3.0V - 2.9V = 100% - 42% (58% drop on 100 mV)
- Section 2: 2.9V - 2.74V = 42% - 18% (24% drop on 160 mV)
- Section 3: 2.74V - 2.44V = 18% - 6% (12% drop on 300 mV)
- Section 4: 2.44V - 2.1V = 6% - 0% (6% drop on 340 mV)

These numbers are by no means accurate. Temperature and
load in the actual application is not accounted for!
